## Detecting spatial patterns--The distribution of blue plaques in the London boroughs

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Load Package}
#first library a few packages that we will use during the practical
#note you may need to install them first...
library(spatstat)
library(here)
library(sp)
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(tmaptools)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Obtain the London Regional Map}
##First, get the London Borough Boundaries
LondonBoroughs <- st_read("/Users/renyanxi/Desktop/lecture/05/homework/London sample/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp")

library(stringr)
BoroughMap <- LondonBoroughs %>%
  dplyr::filter(str_detect(GSS_CODE, "^E09"))%>%
  st_transform(., 27700)

qtm(BoroughMap)

summary(BoroughMap)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r Obtain blue plaque data}
##Now get the location of all Blue Plaques in the City
BluePlaques <- st_read("https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/openplaques/open-plaques-london-2018-04-08.geojson")
BluePlaques <- st_transform(BluePlaques, 27700)

summary(BluePlaques)
```

```{r plot the blue plaques in the city}
tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(BoroughMap) +
  tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0.5)+
tm_shape(BluePlaques) +
  tm_dots(fill = "blue", size=0.1)

```

```{r data cleaning}
#remove duplicates
library(tidyverse)

library(sf)
BluePlaques <- distinct(BluePlaques)

```

```{r satial subsetting}
BluePlaquesSub <- BluePlaques[BoroughMap,]

#plot the blue plaques in the city
tmap_mode("plot")

#check to see that they've been removed
tm_shape(BoroughMap) +
  tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0.5)+
tm_shape(BluePlaquesSub) +
  tm_dots(fill = "blue", size=0.1)

# add sparse=false to get the complete matrix.
# this is the same as select by location in QGIS
# filter from dplyr is the same as select by attribute 
intersect_indices <-st_intersects(BoroughMap, BluePlaques)
```

```{r spatial clipping}
#extract the borough

# select by attribute
Harrow <- BoroughMap %>%
  filter(., NAME=="Harrow")

#Check to see that the correct borough has been pulled out
tm_shape(Harrow) +
  tm_polygons(col = NA, fill_alpha = 0.5)

#clip the data to our single borough
BluePlaquesSub <- BluePlaques[Harrow,]

#check that it's worked
tm_shape(Harrow) +
  tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0.5)+
tm_shape(BluePlaquesSub) +
  tm_dots(fill = "blue", size=0.1)
```

```{r window and conversion PPP,fig.width=8,fig.height=6}
